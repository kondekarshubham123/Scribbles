# HTML 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides a structure for the content on a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags to annotate text, images, and other content, to describe how it should be displayed in a web browser. To create a web page using HTML, the code is written in a text editor, saved with an .html extension, and then opened in a web browser to view the results.
