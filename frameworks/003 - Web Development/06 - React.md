# React

## React Basics - 1

### Theory

1. *React* is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**.

2. React is all about **components**.
    - components: 
        1. Reusable piece of code.
        2. Custom HTML element ðŸ¤«.[For understanding, don't tell to interviewer]

3. *javascript* is based on **imperative approach**.
    - Imperative approach: A software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem.

4. *React* is based on **declarative approach**.
    - Declarative approach: A method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for software to perform an action.

5. *React* follows **SPA approch**.
    - SPA (Single Page application): A web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document.
    - Example: 
        1. Netflix
