Sorting these meetings on their `startTime` will give us: `[[2,3], [2,4], [3,5], [4,5]]`\n2. Merging overlapping meetings:\n\n- `[2,3]` overlaps with `[2,4]`, so after merging we\u2019ll have => `[[2,4], [3,5], [4,5]]`\n- `[2,4]` overlaps with `[3,5]`, so after merging we\u2019ll have => `[[2,5], [4,5]]`\n- `[2,5]` overlaps `[4,5]`, so after merging we\u2019ll have => `[2,5]`\n\nSince all the given meetings have merged into one big meeting `([2,5])`, does this mean that they all are overlapping and we need a minimum of four rooms to hold these meetings? You might have already guessed that the answer is NO! As we can clearly see, some meetings are mutually exclusive. For example, `[2,3]` and `[3,5]` do not overlap and can happen in one room. So, to correctly solve our problem, we need to keep track of the mutual exclusiveness of the overlapping meetings.\n\nHere is what our strategy will look like:\n\n1. We will sort the meetings based on `startTime`.\n2. We will schedule the first meeting (let\u2019s call it `m1`) in one room (let\u2019s call it `r1`).\n3. If the next meeting `m2` is not overlapping with `m1`, we can safely schedule it in the same room `r1`.\n4. If the next meeting `m3` is overlapping with `m2` we can\u2019t use `r1`, so we will schedule it in another room (let\u2019s call it `r2`).\n5. Now if the next meeting `m4` is overlapping with `m3`, we need to see if the room `r1` has become free. For this, we need to keep track of the `endTime` of the meeting happening in it. If the `endTime` of `m2` is before the `startTime` of `m4`, we can use that room `r1`, otherwise, we need to schedule `m4` in another room `r3`.\n\nWe can conclude that we need to <b>keep track of the ending time of all the meetings currently happening</b> so that when we try to schedule a new meeting, we can see what meetings have already ended. We need to put this information in a data structure that can easily give us the smallest ending time. A <i>Min-Heap</i> would fit our requirements best.\n\nSo our algorithm will look like this:\n\n1. Sort all the meetings on their `startTime`.\n2. Create a <i>min-heap</i> to store all the active meetings. This <i>min-heap</i> will also be used to find the active meeting with the smallest `endTime`.\n3. Iterate through all the meetings one by one to add them in the <i>min-heap</i>. Let\u2019s say we are trying to schedule the meeting `m1`.\n4. Since the <i>min-heap</i> contains all the active meetings, so before scheduling `m1` we can remove all meetings from the heap that have ended before `m1`, i.e., remove all meetings from the heap that have an `endTime` smaller than or equal to the `startTime` of `m1`.\n5. Now add `m1` to the heap.\n6. The heap will always have all the overlapping meetings, so we will need rooms for all of them. Keep a counter to remember the maximum size of the heap at any time which will be the minimum number of rooms needed.\n\n````js\nfunction minMeetingRooms(meetings) {\n  //JavaScript does not come with built in Heap, so I used an array to keep track of rooms and sorted by end time at each call\n  if(meetings == null) return 0\n  if(meetings.length <= 1) return meetings.length\n  \n  //helper that returns the meeting room with the earliest end time\n  function getEarliest(room) {\n    room.sort((a,b) => a[1]-b[1])\n    return rooms[0]\n  }\n  \n  //sort meetings on start time\n  meetings.sort((a,b) => a[0]-b[0])\n  \n  let rooms = [meetings[0]]\n  \n  for(let i = 1; i < meetings.length; i++) {\n    let earliestRoom = getEarliest(rooms)\n    let currentTime = meetings[i]\n    \n    //if the room time ends before the currentTime interval starts\n    //then use the room and update the room end time to currentTime\n    if(earliestRoom[1] <= currentTime[0]) {\n      earliestRoom[1] = currentTime[1]\n    } else {\n      //create room\n      rooms.push(currentTime)\n    }\n  }\n  return rooms.length\n}\n\nminMeetingRooms()\nminMeetingRooms([[1,4]])\nminMeetingRooms([[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]])//2, Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings.
